learning python from beginner to pro in three months 
for the addblacnce function i assigned a value to the account_balance variable
then i created another variable for the user to input how much they want to add to their balance but i used int to cover it dos that what is being inputed will be converted to an interger as the account balance varaible is also an integer so i will be easy to add topup and account_balance.
i made the current variable a global variable so that i can be able to use it in the subblance function
